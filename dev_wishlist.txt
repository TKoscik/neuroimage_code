# Features to Add

## generic functions
- power proportion
- combat harmonization

## anatomical pipeline
- T1rho pipeline (check/debug)
- make_template

## diffusion pipeline
- verify tractography pipeline
- connectiviy matrices

## functional pipeline
[ ] ts_deconvolve.sh, additional regression methods options, like robust regression
[ ] ts_censor.sh, timeseries censoring function

## quality control
- qc
    - dicom conversion
    - anatomical pipeline
        - step 1: denoising, alignment, coregistration, brain mask
        - step 2: debias, & normalization
    - baw
    - freesurfer

## modelling workflow
The idea for modelling workflows is to simplify statistical modelling for normal types of models.  
This would include:
    - wrapper functions for simple models (i.e., typical instances of lm, glm, lmer, glmer)
    - options for desired output
    - the idea for this is to generate job, sh, and R files as necessary for simple things
    - with minimal inputs, i.e., which brain data, which subject data, function, and formula
- __mx_to_df.sh__
    - convert matrix (upper triangle) to a row or column vector
    - option for row or column
    - allow multiple inputs (e.g., subjects) to be concatenated in output
    - option to include diagonal
- __model_3d.sh__ for modelling 3-dimensional volumetric data
- __model_4d.sh__ for modelling 4-dimensional volumetric data
- __model_surf.sh__ for modelling surface data, freesurfer surf/curv format to start, maybe move to cifti/gifti
- __model_roi.sh__ for modelling rois
- __model_rsa.sh__ for representational similarity analyses, e.g., on connectivity matrices
- __model_summary.sh__
    - postmodelling operations, including cluster thresholding and generation of images and tables
    - generic to handle output from any of the above modelling functions
    - output is an html report
    - might be better to break this down into subfunctions... like effect_cluster.sh, effect_plot.sh, effect_table.sh, etc. 
- move __combat_harmonization__ into here from generic... and finish writing, should handle 3D, 4D, and tsv/csv inputs
- move __power_proportion__ into here from generic, finish writing, should handle 3D, 4D, and tsv/csv inputs

## quality control
- needed functions:
    - image panels for initial qc of dicoms
    - 3d plane view with ROI overlay for brain mask, navigable html
    - 3d plane view with colored overlay
        - options to specify color bar
        - multiple overlays possible?
        - navigable?
        - easily exportable as publication ready figure?
    - time series gifs?
    - moco/1D plots
    - matrix heatmaps
    - publication ready images
- perhaps not premade, rather it would be nice if we can feed these to the website or email on the fly
