# Neuroimage Processing Code

This repository includes helper functions to conduct neuroimaging analyses in a standardized manner.  
This is forked from original development at the University of Toronto and the University of Iowa by TKoscik and other contributors. As of August 2022, development here and at UIowa have been largely separate.
